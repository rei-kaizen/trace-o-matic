# Trace-O-Matic
This Python application is designed to aid contact tracing efforts and help contain outbreaks of COVID-19. The app prompts users to enter basic information about themselves. This information is used to notify individuals who may have been in close contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case, thereby mitigating the spread of the virus and protecting public health. By collecting and analyzing this data, health authorities can allocate resources more efficiently and respond to outbreaks more effectively.
